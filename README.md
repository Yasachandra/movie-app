Movie App

The project in this repository showcases how the ag-Grid can be used to render a movie collection in Angular 6 with following functionalities:
1. Use of web API to fetch the json collection.
2. A grid UI listing all the movie details returned by the API.
3. Pagination on the UI. Showing only 10 records at a time and allowing users to go back and forth.
4. Sorting and filtering based on column (like in excel sheet).
5. Allowing users to toggle between "Dark" and "Light" themes of the ag-Grid module.
6. Allowing users to filter data on individual columns

Usage
